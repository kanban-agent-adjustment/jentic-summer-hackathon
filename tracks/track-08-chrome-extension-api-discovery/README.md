Track 08 – Chrome Extension for API Discovery

Goal: Build a browser extension that automatically discovers and generates OpenAPI specifications from any website by analyzing network traffic and API calls.

Time Estimate: 4-6 hours
Difficulty: Beginner to Intermediate
Perfect for: Web developers interested in browser APIs, reverse engineering, and making hidden APIs discoverable
What You'll Build

A Chrome extension that:

    Monitors network requests on any website
    Identifies API patterns from HTTP traffic
    Generates OpenAPI specifications automatically
    Exports results for use with Jentic and other tools
    Provides a simple UI for users to trigger discovery

Your deliverable: A working Chrome extension that users can install and use to discover APIs on any website with a single click.
Prerequisites
Technical Requirements

    Basic understanding of JavaScript and web APIs
    Familiarity with Chrome extension development (helpful but not required)
    Understanding of HTTP requests and responses
    Basic knowledge of JSON and API structures

Knowledge Prerequisites

    Understanding of REST APIs and HTTP methods
    Basic familiarity with OpenAPI/Swagger format
    Knowledge of browser developer tools
    No advanced programming experience required

The Problem

Many websites use undocumented APIs that could be useful:

    Internal APIs that power web applications
    Mobile APIs that aren't publicly documented
    AJAX endpoints that handle dynamic content
    Search and filtering APIs that process user queries
    Data APIs that fetch content without page refreshes

Your extension will make these APIs discoverable and usable.
Getting Started (30 minutes)
1. Project Setup

# Create project directory
mkdir chrome-api-discovery
cd chrome-api-discovery

# Create basic extension structure
mkdir -p src/
mkdir -p icons/
mkdir -p popup/
mkdir -p background/
mkdir -p content/

2. Understanding Chrome Extension Architecture

Your extension will have these components:

Manifest v3 Structure:

    Background script - Monitors network requests
    Content script - Interacts with web pages
    Popup UI - User interface for starting discovery
    Storage - Saves discovered API patterns

3. Test Your Development Setup

# Start with a basic extension
# Load extension in Chrome:
# 1. Open chrome://extensions/
# 2. Enable "Developer mode"
# 3. Click "Load unpacked" and select your project folder

Your Implementation Tasks
Phase 1: Basic Extension Framework (90 minutes)
Task 1: Create Extension Manifest

Build the manifest.json that defines your extension:

    Extension metadata and permissions
    Background script registration
    Content script injection
    Network request monitoring permissions

Deliverable: Working extension that loads in Chrome.

File to create: manifest.json
Task 2: Build Popup Interface

Create a simple user interface:

    Button to start/stop API discovery
    Display of discovered endpoints
    Export functionality for OpenAPI specs
    Status indicators and progress feedback

Deliverable: Functional popup that communicates with background script.

Files to create:

    popup/popup.html
    popup/popup.js
    popup/popup.css

Task 3: Implement Network Monitoring

Set up background script to monitor network traffic:

    Listen to all HTTP requests
    Filter for API-like requests (JSON, XML, etc.)
    Store request/response data
    Identify patterns and endpoints

Deliverable: Background script that captures API traffic.

File to create: background/background.js
Phase 2: API Pattern Recognition (120 minutes)
Task 4: Request Analysis Engine

Build logic to identify API patterns:

HTTP Method Detection:

    Identify REST operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    Classify request types (data fetch, form submission, etc.)
    Detect authentication patterns

Endpoint Pattern Recognition:

    Extract base URLs and path patterns
    Identify parameter patterns in URLs
    Group related endpoints by functionality

Data Structure Analysis:

    Analyze JSON request/response structures
    Identify common schema patterns
    Extract parameter types and formats

Deliverable: Engine that can identify and classify API patterns.
Task 5: Content Analysis

Enhance analysis with page context:

    Identify what user actions trigger API calls
    Correlate UI elements with API endpoints
    Extract meaningful operation descriptions
    Detect authentication requirements

Deliverable: Context-aware API discovery.

File to create: content/content.js
Phase 3: OpenAPI Generation (90 minutes)
Task 6: OpenAPI Spec Builder

Create logic to generate valid OpenAPI specifications:

Basic Structure Generation:

    Create OpenAPI 3.0+ compliant structure
    Generate info section with discovered metadata
    Build servers array from detected base URLs
    Organize paths by discovered endpoints

Schema Inference:

    Analyze JSON payloads to infer schemas
    Generate request body schemas
    Create response schemas with examples
    Define parameter schemas with types

Documentation Enhancement:

    Generate operation descriptions from context
    Create meaningful operation IDs
    Add tags for logical grouping
    Include examples from captured traffic

Deliverable: Function that converts discovered APIs to OpenAPI specs.
Task 7: Export and Integration

Implement export functionality:

    Generate downloadable OpenAPI files
    Validate generated specifications
    Provide integration options with Jentic
    Support multiple export formats (YAML/JSON)

Deliverable: Complete export workflow for discovered APIs.
Testing Your Extension

    Review discovered API endpoints
    Export OpenAPI specification
    Validate generated spec with online tools

Common Challenges & Solutions
Chrome Extension Development

Challenge: Understanding Chrome extension architecture Solutions:

    Start with official Chrome extension documentation
    Use simple examples to understand message passing
    Test each component (popup, background, content) separately
    Use Chrome DevTools for debugging

Network Request Analysis

Challenge: Filtering relevant API calls from all network traffic Solutions:

    Focus on XHR and Fetch requests initially
    Filter by content type (application/json, etc.)
    Look for consistent URL patterns
    Ignore static assets (images, CSS, JS files)

OpenAPI Generation Quality

Challenge: Creating meaningful and accurate specifications Solutions:

    Start with basic structure, add sophistication gradually
    Use captured request/response data as examples
    Validate generated specs with online validators
    Focus on most common API patterns first

Extension Permissions

Your extension will need these permissions:

{
  "permissions": [
    "webRequest",           // Monitor network requests
    "storage",             // Store discovered APIs
    "activeTab",           // Access current tab
    "scripting"            // Inject content scripts
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "<all_urls>"           // Access all websites
  ]
}

Security Considerations

    Data Privacy: Don't store sensitive information
    User Consent: Clear about what data is collected
    Secure Storage: Use Chrome storage APIs appropriately
    Permission Scope: Request minimal necessary permissions

Extension Publishing (Optional)

If you want to share your extension:

    Create developer account on Chrome Web Store
    Package extension as .zip file
    Submit for review with proper description
    Include privacy policy and usage instructions

Success Criteria

Your extension succeeds when:

    Users can easily discover APIs on any website
    Generated OpenAPI specs are valid and useful
    Extension is reliable and doesn't break websites
    User interface is intuitive and responsive
    Results integrate well with existing API tools

Real-World Impact

This extension addresses important needs:

    API Discoverability: Makes hidden APIs accessible
    Documentation Generation: Creates specs for undocumented APIs
